# Scissors war

Based on the classic game of rock, paper and scissors in this game you can play as one or two players.

The objective is to destroy the big hand of the other player by sending to them hands of rock, paper and scissors, But keep in mind that they can also create them against you.

To create rocks, papers or scissors you'll have to use the controls displayed. They'll cost you points, points that you'll earn by waiting and destroying the other player hands.
